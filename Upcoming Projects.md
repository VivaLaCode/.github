# About

These are projects that we will work/are working on.
In the future, we could simply use github discussions to decide on what projects to make.

## Schema

1. **Project Title**: name of the project
2. **Proposed By**: person who started/wants to start the project
3. **Toolset**: What tools will be/are used
4. **Description/Objective**: Either description of the project, or a certain goal for a pre-existing project
5. **Repo Status**: Whether a repository for this project is either ``private``, ``public`` or ``uninitialized``
    - ``private``: Repo exists but owner might not have created a minimum workable project
    - ``public``: Repo exists and owner is ready for collaboration
    - ``unitialized``: Repo does not exist, project is simply an idea

## Table

In order of what may be worked on first. Organization members are free to add to this list.

| Project Title | Proposed By | Toolset | Description/Objective | Repo Status |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
